    <p>This is how you and me have been doing to our heroes in some imaginary fighting game:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">CPlayer</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">ProcessInput</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="n">ChangeSprite</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"slap"</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="n">Slap</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Press <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> on your gamepad to slap your foes. Wait… you might slap them again and again by just spamming <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> even when you have not stopped slapping.
You can see that the animation does not look realistic.</p>

<p>Here is a quick fix:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">slapping</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">false</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">// Only slap when we are not slapping.
</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pressed</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"GAMEPAD_CROSS"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">slapping</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">slapping</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Remember that we are still slapping.
</span>
<span class="c1">//...
</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now let’s add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Charge</code> skill.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pressed</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"GAMEPAD_CIRCLE"</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">power</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">released</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"GAMEPAD_CIRCLE"</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">power</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">ChargedPunch</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Things look well at first. You will soon realize there is a way to cheat this game: Hold <code class="highlighter-rouge">Circle</code>, wait for an enemy, press 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> then release <code class="highlighter-rouge">Circle</code> immediately. He lost his focus when he was slapped, and you gave him a powerful punch which he would never
have been able to evade.</p>

<p>When you are in standing state, you can either press <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> to slap or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Circle</code> to punch your foes.
However, during slapping state, you can’t do any input until slapping animation finishes. Same goes for charging state, you must release 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Circle</code> to do a powerful punch before your hero becomes reponsive to other input.</p>
