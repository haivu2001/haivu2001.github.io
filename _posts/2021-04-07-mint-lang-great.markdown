Mint is a promising alternative to JavaScript for building frontend. It has many built-in features similar to
JavaScript frameworks such as Vue, React...

## What's wrong with JavaScript?

- JavaScript is dynamic-typed. It causes so many problems and is very difficult to debug.
- Build tools are too complex.

## Why Mint?
- Everything is _static-typed_ and is an expression.
- Easily write scoped CSS.
- It has an easy-to-use build system to generate production-ready stuffs.

However, I won't use Mint yet because of lack of component libraries and there isn't a large community yet.
