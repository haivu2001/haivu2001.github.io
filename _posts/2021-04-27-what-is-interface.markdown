An interface can be described as the list of actions that an object can do. More precisely, it contains the rules, syntaxer and/or structure that can be used to enforces specific
properties on an object of certain class or component in a large software.

Suppose you have two different RC cars and want to be able to control any of them using the same remote controller. Then you need to design an interface called "RC Car" and then implement all required functions in those two cars.
